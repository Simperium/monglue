Monglue
=======

Monglue is a set of utilities for working with MongoDB, featuring a simple
wrapper for dict that takes care of common store operations and saves you from
exercising the low-level database driver in your tests. It is entirely a work
in progress, subject to change at any time, and implemented in reaction to
real-world issues encountered while building other projects rather than fully
designed up front.
